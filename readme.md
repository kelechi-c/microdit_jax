### microdit_jax

Jax implementation of MicroDiT(Stretching Each Dollar: Diffusion Training from Scratch on a Micro-Budget).
Adapted from the (unofficial) pytorch implementation by [**SwayStar123**](https://github.com/SwayStar123/microdiffusion).

Training/experimentations are proudly sponsored by Google TRC(Tpu Research Cloud).

![microdit_imagenet.py](microdit_imagenet.py) contais the complete(and wacky) code to train a mimcrodit model from scratch on Imagenet(you can also specify a smaller split of the 1.28M images in the `config`).
